# HorsePoseEstimation
Estimating the pose of a horse (from data collection to production in C++).

In this repository I first tried to build a deep learning model for estimating the pose of a racing horse using deepposekit.

## Upcoming
1/ Add C++ code for loading the running the model in production.

2/ Add a simple user interface to see the model in videos.
